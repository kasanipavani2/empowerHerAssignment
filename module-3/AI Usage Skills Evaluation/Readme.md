AI-Powered Daily Time Tracking & Analytics Dashboard
Project Description

A web-based time tracking application that allows users to log daily activities in minutes, analyze how their 24 hours are spent, and visualize data through a clean, responsive dashboard. The system uses Firebase Authentication and Firestore for secure data storage and real-time updates. AI tools were leveraged to enhance UI design, generate sample components, and improve UX flow.
